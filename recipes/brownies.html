<h3>Delicious Fudgy Brownies</h3>
<p>Homemade brownies are my go-to crowd pleasing dessert. Sure, it’s easy to opt for a boxed mix, maybe with a few additions, for quick preparation. But, a rich homemade brownie is worth a few extra ingredients and time.</p>

<p>The issue is most versions end up too cakey, or too fudgy, and not chocolatey enough. After years of perfecting it, this recipe yields perfect moist-in-the-center, crackle-topped, rich chocolate homemade brownies.</p>

<p>You'll find a detailed ingredient list and step-by-step instructions in the recipe below.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>2 1/4 cups granulated sugar</li>
    <li>1/4 cup brown sugar</li>
    <li>1 tsp. salt</li>
    <li>1 Tbsp. vanilla extract</li>
    <li>1 cup unsalted butter, plus more for buttering pan</li>
    <li>1 cup chocolate chips</li>
    <li>6 large eggs</li>
    <li>1/2 cup vegetable oil</li>
    <li>1 tsp. instant espresso powder (optional)</li>
    <li>1 tsp. ground cinnamon (optional)</li>
    <li>1 1/3 cups Dutch-process cocoa powder</li>
    <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1 tsp. baking powder</li>

</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Prepare pan</strong></li>
        <p>Preheat the oven to 350°F. Butter a 13- x 9-in. pan. Alternatively, you can also line it with parchment, butter that, and you’ll be able to turn the entire pan out at once.</p>
    <li><strong>Melt butter and chocolate</strong></li>
        <p>Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat.Add chocolate chips and stir constantly until combined and melted. Remove from heat to cool slightly.</p>
        <li><strong>Combine Sugar and Eggs</strong></li>
        <p>Combine granulated sugar, brown sugar, salt, vanilla extract, eggs, and oil in a bowl. Add espresso powder, cinnamon and cayenne if using.You can whisk by hand or use an electric mixer on medium speed. Mix until well combined and smooth.</p>
    <li><strong>Combine Dry Ingredients</strong></li>
        <p>Sift flour, baking powder, and cocoa together into sugar and egg mixture.Add chocolate mixture. Whisk (or mix on medium) until smooth and glossy.</p>
    <li><strong>Add Batter to Pan</strong></li>
        <p>Pour batter into the prepared pan and bake for approximately 30 minutes.You’ll know it’s done when it only jiggles slightly, the top has a crust, and a toothpick comes out with only crumbs.</p>
    <li><strong>Cool Brownies</strong></li>
        <p>Let cool in the pan on a cooling rack for at least 1 hour, cut, and store in an airtight container with sheets of wax paper in between layers to prevent sticking. The brownies will stay fresh for one week stored at room temperature or up to 6 months frozen.</p>
