<h3>Old-Fashioned Pancakes</h3>
<p>I found this pancake recipe in my Grandma's recipe book. Judging from the weathered look of this recipe card, this was a family favorite.</p>

<p>Perfect pancakes are easier to make than you think. This pancake recipe produces thick, fluffy, and all-around delicious pancakes with just a few ingredients that are probably already in your kitchen (and it's so much better than the boxed stuff).</p>

<p>You'll find a detailed ingredient list and step-by-step instructions in the recipe below, but let's go over the basics</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1.5 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>3.5 teaspoon baking powder</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1 1/4 cups milk</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons melted butter</li>
    <li>1 egg</li>

</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Sift flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt together in a large bowl. Make a well in the center and add milk, melted butter, and egg; mix until smooth.</li>
    <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or pan over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake; cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, about 2 to 3 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side. Repeat with remaining batter.</li>
